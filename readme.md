# WoW Video Encoder

This Go program processes `.mp4` videos located in your `Videos\NVIDIA\World Of Warcraft` folder and creates two versions for each video:

- **Short version:** last 60 seconds, vertical 1080x1920 resolution  
- **Full version:** full length, scaled to max height 1440, keeping aspect ratio  

Both versions are saved into your `Videos` folder with prefixes `short_` and `full_`.
